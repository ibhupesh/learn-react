# learn-react

Public experimental repository for learning React and JavaScript.

This repository is a personal, public playground where I experiment with React, modern JavaScript, and related libraries. It's intentionally lightweight and evolving — expect frequent commits, drafts, and experiments.

## Status

- **Public:** Yes — this is an open experimental repo.
- **Purpose:** Learn and practice React & JavaScript concepts.
- **Stability:** Experimental — not production-ready.

## Goals

- Try new React patterns and hooks
- Build small components and mini-projects
- Practice tooling (ESLint, Prettier, bundling)
- Learn testing and deployment basics

## Getting Started

Prerequisites: Node.js (LTS) and npm or Yarn.

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
```

Run in development mode:

Build for production:

```bash
